7. Imagine (this will happen very soon in real life!), you’ve been stuck on the problem for a while and have no idea what to do - what your next steps would be?

- First, search how to fix that problem, if can't find it ask friends to help, if can't fix again see problem again, is it important in my life or my work, if important do it continues fix, make different conditions, I think don't give up. No problem in the world can't fix bexcause Humans are the ones who create their own problems.
